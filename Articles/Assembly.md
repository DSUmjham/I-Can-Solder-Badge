Make sure you've got a good grasp on the components you are working with and soldering safely before starting this!

The order of assembly is not critical, but this approach should work well:
 1. Verify you have all of the parts needed:
	 1. Badge PCB
	 2. [Battery (CR2032)](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/DSUmjham/I-Can-Solder-Badge/raw/main/Datasheets/CR2032.pdf)
	 3. [Battery Holder](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/DSUmjham/I-Can-Solder-Badge/raw/main/Datasheets/BAT-HLD-001-THM.pdf)
	 4. [Pushbutton (x2)](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/DSUmjham/I-Can-Solder-Badge/raw/main/Datasheets/MJTP1230.pdf)
